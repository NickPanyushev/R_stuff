In this directory FASTA sequences are stored

* common_peaks.fa - uncentered peak regions obtained
* centered_500.fa - common regions elongated to 500 nucleotides and centered on peak summit found by MACS
* centered_1000.fa - the same as above, but elongated to 1000 nucleotides
* MEME_background.zip - contains files with fasta sequences used as background for MEME 
 
For example:
