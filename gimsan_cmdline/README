GIMSAN (GIbbsMarkov Significance ANalysis) README
=================================================
last updated: August 30, 2010

GIMSAN (GIbbsMarkov with Significance ANalysis) is a novel tool for de novo motif finding:

    * Hybrid Gibbs sampler for motif finding that uses a Bayesian prior on the percentage of sequences containing 
      sites but uses a maximum likelihood approach on the motif matrix
    * Biologically realistic and reliable statistical significance analysis
          o Using a 3-Gamma approximation scheme
          o Factoring local sequence composition information
          o Reports an approximate 95% confidence interval of the point estimator of the motif p-value 
    * Can be used to select the optimal width from a range of motif widths based on our significance analysis
	* NEW Column pair dependency estimated using a Monte-Carlo scheme 


REFERENCE
=========
If you use this program in your research, please cite:

Patrick Ng, Uri Keich. GIMSAN: A Gibbs motif finder with significance analysis. Bioinformatics, In press. 


REQUIREMENTS
============
1. Perl 5.8.5 or later
2. R command line version 2.6.1 or later (http://www.r-project.org/). 
   If you are using Mac OS X, see FAQ from www.r-project.org to setup the command line version.


INSTALLATION
============
1. Extract GIMSAN into a directory of your choice: e.g. <GIMSAN_HOME>

2. Change your current working directory to <GIMSAN_HOME>/gimsan_cmdline/

3. Run "bash install.sh". GibbsMarkov should have been compiled, and the tarball of weblogo should have been extracted.

4. Set GIMSAN environment variable as your <GIMSAN_HOME>/gimsan_cmdline/. 
   For example, you can initialize the environment variable in Bash by:

         export GIMSAN=~/gimsan/gimsan-cmdline/

5. Set R_BIN environment variable as the directory where R is located. 
   For example, you can initialize the environment variable in Bash by:

         export R_BIN=/usr/local/bin/


USING GIMSAN
============
There are two main scripts: gimsan_submit_job.pl and gimsan_result.pl
You can find their help menu and examples by running either scripts without any arguments. 

1. gimsan_submit_job.pl - submits a GIMSAN job on your current machine or on a cluster via qsub. 
   Get help by "./gimsan_submit_job.pl" or "perl gimsan_submit_job.pl"

2. gimsan_result.pl - generates a html output of a GIMSAN job and performs motif significance evaluation
   Get help by "./gimsan_result.pl" or "perl gimsan_result.pl"
